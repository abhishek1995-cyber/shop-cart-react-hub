# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description


The Shopping Cart app is a web application that provides users with a seamless online shopping experience. The app integrates with an external API to fetch a wide range of products, which are then displayed in the user interface. To efficiently manage the state of the application, Redux is implemented, ensuring a single source of truth for all the data.

users can apply filters based on brand and price to narrow down their choices making the shopping process more convenient.

When users select a particular item, they have the option to add it to their shopping cart. The shopping cart feature utilizes Redux to keep track of the selected products and their quantities. This way, users can easily manage their chosen items before proceeding to the checkout process.

The app also includes a search functionality, allowing users to search for specific products by their names and a product details page is also added when a users click on product image or name it will show the product full details and description
